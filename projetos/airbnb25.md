# AirBNB New York Revenue Analysis     <font size=2>v2.0</font>
  <code style="color:#4a304f"><font color= #d689e6>bootcamp project</font></code>

This capstone project for the Télos bootcamp addressed the challenge of increasing AirBNB revenue in New York City despite its many platform restrictions. We synthesized our accumulated learning to develop a solution, which we presented to our sponsor, ThoughtWorks, demonstrating our technical capabilities and progress.

#### PySpark [Databricks] (ETL process and handling large-scale data manipulation)
- Data Consolidation & Cleaning: Unified two primary datasets from Kaggle and Inside Airbnb. Performed joins, handled inconsistent formats (e.g., scientific notation), and replaced "N/A" values with nulls.
- Data Wrangling: Extensive null analysis, strategic filtering, and outlier removal (using IQR method) for price data to ensure data quality.
- Data Modeling & Feature Engineering: Split the unified dataset into four logical tables (rooms, hosts, reviews, amenities).
- Advanced Parsing with PySpark: The amenities column, originally a complex string formatted as a list, was parsed using PySpark functions (regexp_replace, split, explode). It was transformed into a structured format and pivoted to create boolean columns for the most relevant amenities.

#### Power BI (data modeling, visualization and building an interactive dashboard)
- Data Model: Established relationships between the imported tables (rooms, hosts, reviews, amenities) to create a robust star schema.
- DAX Calculations: Created key calculated columns for segmentation (e.g., Stay Duration Type) and advanced measures (e.g., Median Est Annual Income PER HOST).
- Interactive Dashboard: Developed a comprehensive report with various visuals (maps, bar charts, matrices, KPIs) and slicers to explore hypotheses and uncover insights dynamically.

### 📊 Dashboard
<img width="1421" height="811" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9b992d9-09ba-4658-9628-6d164cdc12d3" />

We have structured the analysis into four distinct dashboards, each designed to explore a specific facet of the business:

- General Overview: Provides a high-level summary of New York's overall market performance.
- Listings Analysis: Breaks down revenue performance by accommodation type and neighborhood.
- Host Analysis: Highlights the critical influence of host profiles and behaviors on revenue generation.
- Opportunity Analysis: Focused on identifying specific, actionable opportunities for revenue growth by location and market niche.

### 💡 Key Insights
The analysis focused on the **high-performance segment** (listings with high estimated occupancy and high future demand).

| Insight Area | Key Finding | Supporting Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **📍 Location** | Perceived location is a primary revenue driver. | Strong positive correlation between neighborhood's average **location review score** and historical occupancy rate, especially for short-term stays. |
| **💰 Pricing & Stay Duration** | Short-term stays (<30 days) are the most profitable segment despite regulations. | Short-term rentals generated **$131M** vs **$110M** for long-term stays, despite being minority in volume. |
| **🏆 Host Status** | **Superhost status** commands a significant price premium. | Superhosts charge higher daily rates and achieve higher **median revenue** in high-performance segment where occupancy is already high. |
| **📈 Host Portfolio** | Portfolio size drives total revenue more than status alone. | Some Non-Superhosts with extensive portfolios outperform Superhosts in total revenue through volume, despite lower per-listing prices. |
| **🔄 Host Lifecycle** | Host revenue performance is non-linear. | Average host revenue peaks at **3-5 years** of experience, then stagnates or declines. |
| **🛋️ Amenities** | Minimal direct impact on pricing premium. | No clear correlation between specific amenities and significant price increases. Value tied to location and structural factors. |
| **⚡ Host Responsiveness** | Limited impact for high-performers. | High response/acceptance rates don't translate to significant gains beyond Superhost eligibility requirements. |
